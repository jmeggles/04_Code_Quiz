## How it works
Open the Code Quiz with the following links to view and begin the quiz.  The quiz qill start with a welcome page where a button needs to be ressed to begin the game.  The first question is presented along with 4 choices of answers and the timer begins to count down.  When a correct selection to that answer has been made, a point will be added to the scoreboard, the next question appears, and the timer is not affected.  However, if an incorrect answer is selected to that questions, the timer will deduct time and no points are added to the score.  So choose wisely!  When either the timer runs out or all questions have been answered, the game is over and a score will be presented.  Replay to see if you can guess them all correctly!  The player can add his/her name to the winner's score form at the end.
