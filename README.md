## How it works
Open the Code Quiz with the above links to view and begin the quiz.  The quiz will start with a welcome page where a button needs to be pressed to begin the game.  The first question is presented along with 4 choices of answers and the timer begins to count down.  When a correct selection to that answer has been made, a point will be added to the score counter at the top right of the page, the next question appears, and the timer is not affected.  However, if an incorrect answer is selected to that questions, the timer on the top left of the page will remove 10 seconds and no points are added to the score.  When either the timer runs out or all questions have been answered, the game is over and a score will be presented.  So choose wisely!  Replay to see if you can guess them all correctly!  The player can add his/her initials to the winner's score form at the end.
