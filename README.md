# 04_Code_Quiz
making a code quiz using web APIs

### How it works...
Begin by clicking on the start button.  Answer questions as they appear, but watch out for that timeclock!  It counts down AND takes additional time off for incorrect answers.  The results will be given at the end.  Only 5 questions, so lets test your random knowledge!

#### Notes
This was quite challenging due to learning additional items needed before submission. Used CSS formatting ideas from the bootstrap project but would like to have made it better.  Time crunch didn't allow for more detail.
